# About me

Hello! My name is **Lucas**, I'm **14 years old**, and I'm a programming enthusiast from Brazil. I started studying programming in 2022, and it has been an exciting journey so far. My goal is to become a software developer and make a meaningful impact in the technology industry.

## Skills and Experience

- Node.js (80%)
- Python (20%)
- Lua and C (basic knowledge)

I have been studying Node.js extensively over the past year and have a good grasp of the technology. Recently I started studying Python and aim to delve deeper. I also have some basic knowledge of Lua and C that I have used to create a few small projects. I usually develop APIs for various purposes and occasionally create bots for Discord.

## Education

I don't have formal education in programming yet, but I have been studying through online courses and tutorials.

## Contact

You can reach me through my **[Discord profile](https://discord.com/users/1036018691562803260)**. I'm happy to connect with other developers and chat about technology! I also have a few repositories on **[GitHub](https://github.com/your_username_here)** with some of my projects. While I don't usually work on large projects, I hope they can be useful to others in the community.
