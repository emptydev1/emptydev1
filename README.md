  I have been studying Node.js extensively over the past year and have a good grasp of the technology. Recently I started studying Python and aim to delve deeper. I also have some basic knowledge of Lua and C that I have used to create a few small projects. I usually develop APIs for various purposes and occasionally create bots for Discord.
